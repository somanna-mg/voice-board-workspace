│   ├── ui/
│   └── dev/
├── hooks/
├── services/
├── stores/
├── types/

- **Components**: `FeatureName.tsx`
- **Types**: `feature-name.types.ts`
- **Tests**: `__tests__/` directory
- **Hooks**: Feature-specific hooks
- **Services**: Feature-specific business logic

## 📦 New API Client Package

### ✅ Created Complete Structure
```
packages/api-client/
├── src/
│   ├── command-router/         # ✅ Command processing client
│   ├── voice/                  # ✅ Audio recording & processing
│   ├── httpClient.ts          # ✅ Base HTTP client with interceptors
│   └── index.ts               # ✅ Package exports
├── package.json               # ✅ Package configuration
└── tsconfig.json              # ✅ TypeScript configuration
```

## 🔧 Development Tools

### ✅ Configuration Files
- **Created**: `tools/configs/tsconfig.base.json` - Base TypeScript config
- **Created**: `tools/scripts/create-feature.js` - Feature scaffolding script
- **Updated**: All package `tsconfig.json` files to extend base config

### ✅ Scripts & Utilities
- **Feature Creation**: `node tools/scripts/create-feature.js <name> <package>`
- **Package Scripts**: All updated to work with new structure

## 📚 Documentation

### ✅ Created Documentation
- **Created**: `docs/guides/getting-started.md` - Complete getting started guide
- **Updated**: Import statements in web app to use new package names

## 🏗️ Key Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Feature Colocation
- All voice-related code is now in `features/voice-control/`
- Array visualization code is in `features/array-element/`
- Related code lives together (components, types, tests, hooks)

### ✅ Clear Separation
- **Apps**: Runnable applications (`web`)
- **Packages**: Reusable packages (`canvas`, `api-client`, `shared-types`)
- **Backend**: Microservices with clear naming
- **Tools**: Development utilities and configurations

### ✅ Improved Developer Experience
- Feature scaffolding script for consistent structure
- Shared TypeScript configuration
- Clear naming conventions
- Better package organization

## 🚀 Ready for Development

### ✅ Package Dependencies Updated
- Web app now imports from `@voice-board/canvas`
- Canvas package uses `@voice-board/shared-types`
- All internal references updated

### ✅ Monorepo Configuration
- pnpm workspace correctly configured
- Turbo build pipeline ready
- All packages properly linked

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pnpm install` to install all packages
2. **Development**: Use `pnpm dev` to start development
3. **Feature Development**: Use scaffolding script to create new features
4. **Testing**: Run `pnpm test` to test all packages
